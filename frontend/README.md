# Project Music4you using reactjs, Node and Mongo.

The project does also include the frontend library Bootstrap, fontawesome icons, styled-components to customize the styles in the Register page.

Jquery has been also installed and used to filter the songs displayed in the songs page..

When the user is not registered or logged in, the songs page displays the content of the artists *band name, song name and picture*, but the audio file will popup when the user logs in.

# Back end

Using MongoDB. The user fills out the register form, the data is saved to the database. The password is saved encrypted using Bcrypt..
Upong logging in, using localStorage, the login form creates a token which ends up being used to successfully displays the audio files.
When the user logs out, the token will dissapear, reason for which the audio tag is automatically removed.

To successfully log in please use Gus24 as username with the password 4567
or you may complete the sign up form.
Note: Sometimes the server needs to be updated in the backend.





































# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
